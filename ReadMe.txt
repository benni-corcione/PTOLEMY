PROGRAMS:

AndCommon             : libreria di funzioni di fp (grafici, lavori su TGraph, stringhe, analisi statistica minima)
amp_charge            : graph of  amp vs charge (with linear fit)
B60_H60               : superimposed histos of counts of aligned/disaligned TES wrt CNTs
CD_details            : info to reconstruct plot and analysis on different cooldowns
checkpshape           : draw selected pshape
dark_counts           : disegno pshape a persistenza, ampli e charge come histos
double_check          : algoritmo con deltaY cumulata e smoothata per individuare doppie, poi disegnate
draw_three_electrons  : draw pshapes of three electrons superimposed (fit if you want)
drawAmpCharge         : draw amp and charge of specific dataset
drawFinalFits         : draw fits and final trends of mu and reso for each cd,meas,amp/charge chosen, only if the functions are updated with the correct options of draw and fits (to fastly recover drawings and fits of 'stacks' of datasets)
fitAmpChargeData      : fitting histograms (where to decide ranges and fits params)
graphics              : graphic options and similar functions recalled in programs
lecroyparser          : library to read trc files from waverunner
makeAllrawTree        : loop over files in folder that compiles makeRawTree
makeAllrawTreePhotons : loop over files in folder (with photons only please) that compiles makeRawTreePhotons
makeRawTree           : create one rawtree for each file.trc read
makeRawTreePhotons    : create one rawtree for each file.trc read (photons only please)
makeTree              : make high level quantities tree from rawtree of pshapes
makeTreePhotons       : make high level quantities tree from rawtree of pshapes (photons only please)
persistance_plot      : draw persistance plot of pshapes
pshape_functions      : functions acting on the pshapes saved point by point
wp_analysis           : draw histos of amp/charge superimposed and normalized for each i_bias in the stack
writeHistoPhotons     : write on txt file amp/charge histo of photons (of decided bins) to import on Origin
